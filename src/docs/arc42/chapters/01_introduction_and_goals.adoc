== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
endif::arc42help[]

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

The AsciiDoc MCP Server provides structured access to AsciiDoc documents for Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the current gap in semantic document analysis capabilities.

==== Driving Forces

* **LLM Integration Gap**: Existing tools lack structured access to AsciiDoc document semantics, forcing LLMs to work with raw text without understanding of hierarchies, includes, or cross-references
* **Mixed Code/Documentation Projects**: Software engineering teams need unified workflows that handle both source code and documentation in single repositories  
* **Local Development Requirements**: Teams require local execution capabilities with optional containerization for security and control
* **Specialization Need**: General-purpose tools like Serena MCP focus on code intelligence, leaving documentation-specific needs unaddressed

==== Core Functional Requirements

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Requirement|Description
|Document Structure Analysis|Parse AsciiDoc heading hierarchies and section organization with configurable content inclusion
|Include Resolution|Discover and resolve include directives recursively with dependency tracking
|Metadata Extraction|Extract document attributes, author information, revision details, and file metadata
|Content Search|Perform semantic search within documents with contextual result presentation
|Cross-Reference Validation|*(Future)* Validate internal links and references for document integrity
|Asset Analysis|*(Future)* Analyze embedded images, diagrams, and multimedia content
|===

==== Architecture Constraints

* **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Compliance**: Full adherence to MCP specification for LLM tool integration
* **Python 3.8+ Runtime**: Cross-platform compatibility with modern Python environments  
* **Local-First Execution**: Primary deployment mode for security and offline capabilities
* **Optional Containerization**: Docker support for consistent deployment environments
* **Single-User Focus**: Optimized for individual developer workflows, not multi-tenant scenarios

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Priority|Quality Goal|Scenario & Rationale
|1|**Reliability & Robustness**|The system must handle malformed AsciiDoc documents gracefully without crashing. _Scenario_: When processing a document with syntax errors, return structured error information instead of terminating. This is critical since LLMs depend on consistent responses for effective workflow orchestration.

|2|**Performance & Efficiency**|Document analysis operations must complete within 2 seconds for files up to 10MB. _Scenario_: A developer working with large documentation repositories needs immediate feedback. Slow response times break the interactive development flow and reduce LLM effectiveness.

|3|**Usability & Developer Experience**|Tool interfaces must be self-documenting with clear error messages and expected input formats. _Scenario_: A software engineer using Claude Desktop should understand tool capabilities without referring to external documentation. Poor UX leads to adoption failure.

|4|**Maintainability & Extensibility**|Core functionality must support future feature additions (cross-reference validation, asset analysis) without architectural changes. _Scenario_: Adding new document analysis capabilities should not require refactoring existing tool implementations.

|5|**Compatibility & Interoperability**|Must work seamlessly alongside other MCP servers (especially Serena for code analysis) in the same client session. _Scenario_: LLM workflows that combine code analysis and documentation tasks should not experience conflicts or coordination issues.

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
