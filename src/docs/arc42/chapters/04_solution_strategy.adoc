.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/[Solution Strategy] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Technology Decisions

The AsciiDoc MCP Server technology stack and architectural patterns are documented in the following Architecture Decision Records:

* **link:../adrs/ADR001-Idea.adoc[ADR-001: Standalone AsciiDoc MCP Server]** - Establishes the fundamental decision to create an independent AsciiDoc MCP server rather than extending existing tools
* **link:../adrs/ADR002-Technology-Stack.adoc[ADR-002: Technology Stack Selection]** - Documents the selection of Python 3.8+ runtime and MCP protocol adoption
* **link:../adrs/ADR003-Architecture-Pattern.adoc[ADR-003: Tool-Based Service Architecture]** - Defines the architectural pattern using tool-based services with a central processor

These decisions collectively establish:

|===
|Decision Area|Selected Approach
|**Runtime Platform**|Python 3.8+ for ecosystem maturity and cross-platform compatibility
|**Integration Protocol**|Model Context Protocol (MCP) via JSON-RPC over stdio
|**System Architecture**|Standalone server independent of other MCP implementations
|**Service Pattern**|Tool-based architecture with centralized AsciiDoc processor
|**Deployment Model**|Local execution with optional Docker containerization
|===

=== Architectural Patterns

The system follows architectural patterns detailed in **link:../adrs/ADR003-Architecture-Pattern.adoc[ADR-003: Tool-Based Service Architecture]**:

**Tool-Based Service Architecture**
* Each MCP tool represents a distinct document analysis capability
* Stateless request/response pattern ensures reliability  
* Clear tool boundaries enable independent feature evolution
* JSON schema validation provides contract enforcement

**Processor Pattern**
* Central `AsciiDocProcessor` encapsulates all document analysis logic
* Individual tools delegate to processor methods for consistency
* Shared error handling and validation across all operations
* Enables future caching and optimization strategies

This approach provides the foundation for all quality achievement strategies and deployment models described below.

=== Quality Achievement Strategies

[options="header",cols="2,3"]
|===
|Quality Goal|Solution Strategy
|**Reliability & Robustness**|• Comprehensive input validation at tool boundaries +
• Graceful degradation for malformed documents +
• Structured error responses with context +
• No state persistence between requests

|**Performance & Efficiency**|• Lazy loading of document content +
• Stream processing for large files +
• Efficient parsing with minimal memory footprint +
• Async I/O throughout the request pipeline

|**Usability & Developer Experience**|• Self-documenting tool schemas +
• Rich error messages with correction hints +
• Consistent JSON output formats +
• Optional verbose modes for debugging

|**Maintainability & Extensibility**|• Modular processor design with clear interfaces +
• Comprehensive test coverage for all tools +
• Plugin-ready architecture for future capabilities +
• Clean separation of concerns (parsing/analysis/output)

|**Compatibility & Interoperability**|• Strict MCP protocol adherence +
• Independent process model (no shared state) +
• Standard exit codes and signal handling +
• Configurable resource limits

=== Deployment Strategy

.Primary
Local execution for development workflows

* Direct installation via pip/uvx for immediate access
* Integrates with existing development environments
* Full filesystem access for repository-wide analysis

.Secondary
Containerized deployment for production

* Docker image for consistent execution environments  
* Volume mounting for document access
* Resource limits and security boundaries
* CI/CD pipeline integration capabilities

=== Key Design Principles

. **Single Responsibility**: Each tool has one clear, well-defined purpose
. **Fail Fast**: Input validation and early error detection
. **Be Conservative**: Read-only operations, no file modifications
. **Stay Simple**: Minimal configuration, maximum automation
. **Think Local**: Optimized for single-user, local development scenarios
