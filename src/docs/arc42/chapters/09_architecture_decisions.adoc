== Architecture Decisions

.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.

=== Fundamental Architectural Decisions

The core architectural decisions for the AsciiDoc MCP Server are documented as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the dedicated ADR directory. These decisions form the foundation of the system design and implementation approach.

=== ADR-001: Standalone AsciiDoc MCP Server

**Decision**: Develop a standalone AsciiDoc MCP server instead of extending existing tools like Serena MCP.

**Status**: ✅ Decided and Implemented

**Context**: 
* Need for specialized AsciiDoc document intelligence for LLMs
* Existing tools focus on code analysis, not documentation semantics  
* Serena MCP has single language server limitation
* Documentation workflows require different optimization than code analysis

**Decision Rationale**:
* **Specialization**: Dedicated focus on AsciiDoc-specific features
* **Architecture Clarity**: Clean separation from code analysis concerns
* **Parallel Operation**: Can work alongside Serena for combined workflows
* **Independent Evolution**: No constraints from code-focused roadmaps

**Consequences**:
* ✅ **Positive**: Optimal AsciiDoc feature development, clear domain boundaries, parallel MCP deployment
* ⚠️ **Risks**: Additional development effort, community building needed, coordination overhead

**References**: 
* Full decision details: link:../adrs/ADR001-Idea.adoc[ADR-001: Standalone AsciiDoc MCP Server]
* Implementation: Current system architecture in Chapters 4-5

=== Secondary Architectural Decisions

|===
|Decision|Alternatives Considered|Rationale|Impact

|**Python 3.8+ Runtime**
|Node.js, Go, Rust
|Mature AsciiDoc ecosystem, async/await support, cross-platform compatibility
|Medium

|**MCP Protocol Compliance**
|Custom protocol, gRPC, REST API
|Industry standard for LLM integration, JSON-RPC simplicity, tool ecosystem
|High

|**Stateless Processing**
|Session-based, cached processing
|Reliability, concurrency, simple deployment
|Medium

|**Read-Only File Access**
|Full file system access
|Security, predictability, side-effect prevention
|Low

|**Tool-Based Architecture**
|Monolithic API, plugin system
|MCP protocol alignment, clear capabilities, extensibility
|High

=== Future Decisions

.Pending Decisions

(to be documented as ADRs when addressed):

1. **Cross-Reference Validation Implementation** - Algorithm choice for link validation and circular reference detection
2. **Asset Analysis Capabilities** - Scope and depth of image/diagram analysis features  
3. **Caching Strategy** - Memory vs. disk caching for frequently accessed documents
4. **Multi-Format Support** - Extension to Markdown and other markup formats
5. **Performance Optimization** - Streaming vs. batch processing for large document sets

.Decision Process

All significant architectural decisions follow the ADR template and are stored in `src/docs/arc42/adrs/` for traceability and stakeholder review.
