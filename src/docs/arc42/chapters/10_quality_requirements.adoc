== Quality Requirements


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Tree

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.

==== Reliability & Error Handling Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3,3"]
|===
|ID|Scenario|Stimulus|Expected Response

|R1|**Malformed Document Processing**
|User provides AsciiDoc file with syntax errors, broken includes, or invalid attributes
|System returns structured error information including error location, type, and suggestions. Processing continues for valid portions of the document.

|R2|**Missing Include Files**
|Document references include files that don't exist or are not accessible
|System reports missing includes with file paths, continues processing main document, provides partial results with clear indication of missing content.

|R3|**Large File Handling**
|User attempts to analyze document exceeding 10MB size limit
|System gracefully rejects request with clear error message indicating size limit and current file size. No system crash or resource exhaustion.

|R4|**Concurrent Request Processing**
|Multiple MCP clients send simultaneous requests
|Each request processed independently without interference. Response times remain within SLA. No data corruption or mixed responses.
|===

==== Performance & Efficiency Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3,3"]
|===
|ID|Scenario|Stimulus|Expected Response

|P1|**Standard Document Analysis**
|User requests structure analysis of typical 1MB documentation file with 50 headings and 10 includes
|System completes analysis and returns results within 2 seconds. Memory usage stays below 50MB during processing.

|P2|**Search Performance**
|User performs content search across 100-file documentation project (total 50MB)
|Search completes within 5 seconds. Results include context and relevance ranking. Memory usage scales linearly with file count.

|P3|**Include Resolution Performance**
|Document with 5-level deep includes (50+ files total)
|Complete dependency resolution within 3 seconds. Circular dependency detection without infinite loops. Clear dependency graph in response.

|P4|**Memory Efficiency**
|Processing multiple large documents in sequence
|Memory usage resets between requests. No memory leaks detected after 1000 operations. Peak memory stays under 100MB per request.
|===

==== Usability & Developer Experience Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3,3"]
|===
|ID|Scenario|Stimulus|Expected Response

|U1|**Self-Documentation**
|Developer discovers tool via MCP client tool list
|Tool descriptions, input schemas, and examples are clear enough for immediate use without external documentation. All parameters clearly documented.

|U2|**Clear Error Messages**
|User provides invalid file path or malformed parameters
|Error messages include specific problem description, expected format, and correction suggestions. Error response follows consistent JSON schema.

|U3|**Integration Setup**
|New user adds AsciiDoc MCP to Claude Desktop configuration
|Installation works on first try with provided configuration examples. Clear troubleshooting guidance for common issues.

|U4|**Debugging Support**
|User encounters unexpected results from document analysis
|Verbose mode provides detailed processing steps. Intermediate results available for troubleshooting. Clear logging without sensitive information exposure.
|===

==== Maintainability & Extension Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3,3"]
|===
|ID|Scenario|Stimulus|Expected Response

|M1|**New Tool Addition**
|Developer adds cross-reference validation tool
|New tool integrates through existing processor interface. No changes to server handler or existing tools. Full test coverage achievable.

|M2|**Protocol Updates**
|MCP protocol specification adds new features
|System architecture supports protocol updates without core logic changes. Backward compatibility maintained for existing clients.

|M3|**Testing & Validation**
|Continuous integration runs full test suite
|All tests complete within 30 seconds. Coverage reports show >90% code coverage. Integration tests validate MCP protocol compliance.

|M4|**Code Quality Maintenance**
|Developer modifies processor logic
|Linting, type checking, and formatting tools ensure code quality. Clear module boundaries prevent coupling issues. Documentation updates automatically verified.
|===

==== Compatibility & Interoperability Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3,3"]
|===
|ID|Scenario|Stimulus|Expected Response

|I1|**Multi-MCP Operation**
|User runs AsciiDoc MCP alongside Serena MCP in same client session
|Both MCPs operate independently without interference. LLM can orchestrate workflows using both servers. No resource conflicts or coordination issues.

|I2|**Platform Compatibility**
|User installs and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
|Identical functionality across all platforms. File path handling adapts to OS conventions. No platform-specific dependencies.

|I3|**Python Version Support**
|User runs with Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
|Full functionality available across supported Python versions. Dependency compatibility maintained. No version-specific bugs.

|I4|**Container Deployment**
|DevOps team deploys in Docker container with volume mounts
|Container starts successfully with mounted documentation directories. Performance equivalent to native execution. Resource limits respected.
